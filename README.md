## Abuse Detection App (ADA)
A system that allows authority to detect if a certain child has undergone abuse.

The system is divided into two parts - the game itself and the admin.

The game will be played by the children without knowing that their answers can lead to indicators if they have been abused or not.

The admin contains real-time reports on the results of the children's game sessions. Users, admins, schools, classes, teachers, and students can also be managed here.
